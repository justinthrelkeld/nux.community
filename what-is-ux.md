UX or User Experience is everything the user of an app or site touches, sees, clicks, taps, and experiences; where user goals meet business goals.

UX managers and hands-on leads strategize with business and product teams to define strategy, and work with implementation teams to deliver solutions.

UI stands for User Interface, which is the screen or surface a user sees and interacts with. UI comes from the UX and product strategy; UI is the tangible output.
